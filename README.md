Bacteriophages are a class of viruses that infect and destroy bacteria. For this reason, they are an emerging focus in research due to their potential use in treating antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. Tarleton State University is working on an interdepartmental project between the departments of mathematics and biology to create a mathematical model for the complexity of bacteriophage infection of host cells. A system of 4n+1 differential equations was derived to model these interactions where interaction between different bacteriophages is not occuring. This system of equations was then used to simulate results for the infection outcomes of the different populations. These results were then evaluated in search of equilibria for populations in a given parameter space. It is our hope that these simulated equilibria can be used to identify infection outcomes for bacteriophages used in clinical settings to speed up testing before usage and effectively improve patient outcomes.
